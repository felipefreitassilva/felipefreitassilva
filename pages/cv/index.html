							I am a Software Engineering student at PUCRS, and I love to learn new technologies and languages. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and improve my skills. In my free time, I like to play video games, watch movies and series, and read books, as well as to program, of course.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my three years of University, I have already had the opportunity to work on several projects, both in the academic and professional fields. I have already worked with several technologies, such as React, React Native, Typescript, Python, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL, C#, among others. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and improve my skills. I have a <a href="https://github.com/EngenhariaSoftwarePUCRS">GitHub profile where I have all of my academic projects organized</a>, feel free to check it out.
						</p>
						<p>
							Besides the academic projects, I have developed some websites and even some mobile applications of my own, the latest of which I managed to publish to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/br/app/ju%C3%ADzes-rally-british-club/id6502790506">App Store</a>. This latest release made me very proud, as even tough this was a relatively small project, it was a valuable product which was actually used and tested with a larger group of people, with a lot of positive and constructive feedback.

								<h5>September 2023 - Current</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>
										As an intern in a team with 1-4 other colleagues, I participated in a project to develop an API with large data filtering and manipulation logic. The project had three main fronts in which I participated: the development of the API, the development of the front-end, and the development of a terminal application to interact with the API. We also had a simple database to store the data, developed tests for the main functionalities of the API, implemented some minor GitHub Actions to automate the testing process, and created a simple Dockerfile to facilitate the deployment of the API.
									</li>
									<li>
										Initially, I was responsible for the logic of the API, which involved creating routes, models, and controllers. I also implemented some unit tests with pytest, and configured it to create a temporary instance of the database for each test session to maintain the integrity of the tests. Eventually, after finishing the API, I also became responsible for the CLI application and the Web based front-end, which were previously developed by other colleagues.
									</li>
									<li>
										I have learned and grown a lot in this project, in many different areas, such as: working better in a team (i.e: reviewing commits), how to develop a project from scratch, the importance of unit testing (things would have broken a lot more sneakily without them), how to best integrate Docker in the development process and how to document a code and a project more properly. Not to mention the technical skills I have acquired and friends I have made.

										Juízes Rally - British Club
									</a>
								</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Juízes Rally is a mobile application developed for the British Club, a private club in Porto Alegre, Brazil. The app was developed to be used in a rally event organized by the club, in which the judges would have to register the times of the participants in the event. Usually, this process is done manually, with the judges writing down the times on paper, which can be a slow and error-prone process. The app was developed to make this process easier and faster, with the judges being able to register the times of the participants in the app using just one simple click, and the app would automatically calculate the final time of each participant, as well as the final classification of the event.
									</li>
									<li>
										The app was developed using React Native, and it was published to the App Store, having been continuously updated both in the Apple and Google stores, whose publication process was slower, and therefore, the app was only in beta version there. The app was used by about 15 people, and it was a good success, with a lot of positive feedback from the participants. Even though this was a relatively small project, it was a valuable product that was actually used and much iterated/tested with a larger group of people, with a lot of positive and constructive feedback to improve the app in the future.

										Project Objectives: Develop a digital platform that allows employees to receive a monthly virtual currency. Implement a donation system, in which employees can donate their virtual coins to recognize and value the positive actions of other co-workers. Create a virtual store in which employees can exchange their accumulated virtual coins for tangible rewards or benefits.

									<li>
										Today it takes customers an average of 5 to 6 hours to register a new car. Updating cars and values takes around 2 to 3 hours, with a lot of time lost for simple registration and with many risks of typing errors, which could cause problems for the company.
									</li>
									<li>
										Project Objectives: Develop a web system that can assist in registering and updating product information (cars) quickly and effectively. Today all data comes via PDF, such as: model, engine, door, interior color, seats, price, etc... The challenge of this project is the organization and structuring of a database, both capture and starting with reading PDF, as well as delivery, exporting the data to the customer's system.
